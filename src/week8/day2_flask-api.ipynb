An application is supposed to handle that as if a GET request was received but to not deliver the actual content. In Flask you donâ€™t have to deal with that at all, the underlying Werkzeug library handles that for you.\n",

    "PUT | Similar to POST but the server might trigger the store procedure multiple times by overwriting the old values more than once. Now you might be asking why this is useful, but there are some good reasons to do it this way. Consider that the connection is lost during transmission: in this situation a system between the browser and the server might receive the request safely a second time without breaking things. With POST that would not be possible because it must only be triggered once.\n",
